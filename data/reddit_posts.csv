My cat‚Äôs behavior did a 180,"So I rescued my cat Penelope back in summer of 2021 when I was living with my grandparents. She lives with them full time and is only talkative during meal time. She‚Äôs currently staying with my fianc√© and I and it seems her behavior has completely changed. Yesterday and last night I understood because she got stress induced urinary cystitis (had to go to emergency vet). They gave her medicine and said she should be feeling better by the end of today.
She‚Äôs usually distant with me, but has been all over my fianc√© and I since bringing her home and even literally having conversations with my fianc√©. She‚Äôs eating and drinking and hiding like normal, but she even slept in bed with us last night. My grandmother is her bonded person but she‚Äôs in the hospital after a really bad fall and her AFIB acting up again. Is it possible she‚Äôs being more active with us because we are younger and do a lot more during the day? Or maybe she noticed my fianc√© and I are more affectionate with each other? Or is it a worst case thing and she knows my grandmother may not have longer so she‚Äôs bonding with us now? Oh also I added a picture so you all can see how cute she was last night at bedtime.",1eidddr,1,0,https://i.redd.it/v8gg6tw8u9gd1.jpeg,2024-08-02 16:44:50

Cuddly cats,,1eida57,1,0,https://i.redd.it/nmehhw8ot9gd1.jpeg,2024-08-02 16:41:12
The best find ever,"I found this lovely tuxedo kitten outside in the cold winter (I named her Misha). She fell asleep in my arms and I knew she and I were meant for each other. 

I‚Äôve had dogs all my life and my experiences with cats have been pretty negative but this cat has truly changed my mind completely.

Every morning, we have a cuddle session and then playtime. Then she snoozes next to me while I work. She loves being outside so I bought a little covered play pen and take her outside. I am always thinking about her happiness. 

She came to me at a time when I was super depressed and she cheers me up everyday. 

I found her when she was 4-6 months old and now shes a year old!

TLDR; pictures of my kitten growing up from a 4-6 month kitten to a year old

My kitty Emberly crossed the rainbow bridge this morning.,"I adopted Emberly as a kitten when I was volunteering at a cat sanctuary around 15 years ago. A year later, I adopted my next cat, Pernell.
Emberly was precocious. Running through the apartment and eventually house. Leaping great heights. Cuddling frequently with me as well as his brother. Years down the road, he gained two ""sisters"" Hattie, a pitbull and Jolene, a beagle. He was a great brother to all. 
He was with me through many hard times and went through hard times himself. I did my best to give him an amazing life. It was a hard decision this morning but I didn't want him to suffer through diagnostics and tests to maybe find a few more years within him. It felt selfish. 
I thank this community, so many words of wisdom on other euthanasia posts that I spent all night reading. Thank you to my husband, being my strength - listening and reassuring me that my decision was the kindest. 
I'll miss his ontime wakeup call (meowing right by my head), cuddles, silliness, tearing through the house. 
I have three fur babies to hug tight still but, there will be a piece missing for a while. ",1eicxyj,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1eicxyj,2024-08-02 16:27:17

Is it necessary to get my cats neutered? ,"I got two 5 month old male cats and they should be neutering age by next month, my issue is besides the price of doing both I'm worried about medical issues that could arise plus I love the little guys and I've heard lots of people say that their personality changes after getting neutered. Is it okay if I skip neutering them? (the chances of them getting another cat pregnant is pretty much 0 cause they're indoors cats plus I live in an isolated country side where there isn't another cat in like a 100km radius) ",1eidl90,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1eidl90/is_it_necessary_to_get_my_cats_neutered/,2024-08-02 16:53:41
